# Ultimate ASP.NET Core Web API

## Book Information
**Title:** Ultimate ASP.NET Core Web API  
**Author:** Trevoir Williams  
**Platform:** Udemy (Course/Book Combo)

## My Progress
ðŸ“š I have reached **Chapter 6: Get Additional Resources**.  
ðŸš§ I'm currently waiting to implement a code or project sample to summarize what Iâ€™ve learned so far. It will be added here once completed.

## What Iâ€™ve Learned So Far
- Setting up a .NET Web API project
- Configuring Services and Middleware
- Dependency Injection & Repository Pattern
- Using Entity Framework Core
- Basic CRUD operations

## Planned Project (Coming Soon ðŸš€)
I will build a practical project (e.g., a Hotel Management API) based on the bookâ€™s practices and put the full code in this folder with documentation.

Stay tuned!
