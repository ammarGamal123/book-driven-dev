# 📚 Book-Driven Development

> **Reading and building through code during my mandatory military service.**

## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is my personal initiative to keep my programming skills sharp and to level up professionally during my time in mandatory military service. I believe that *continuous learning through high-quality books and hands-on practice* is the best way to become a better software engineer.

Each folder in this repository represents a book I've read — where I take notes, build related mini-projects, and summarize the core concepts in my own way.

## 🧠 Goals

- Maintain and grow my programming skills during military service.
- Deepen my understanding of core computer science and software engineering topics.
- Build a rich portfolio of practical code samples and book summaries.
- Keep track of my progress and commit to lifelong learning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack Involved

Depending on the book, I'm using various technologies, including:

- `C#` / `.NET Core Web API`
- `Entity Framework Core`
- `SQL Server`
- `JavaScript` / `Browser APIs`
- `Markdown` for documentation
- `Git` & `GitHub` for version control

## 💡 Why This Matters

Military service is often seen as a break from one’s career. I’m turning it into an opportunity to:

- Revisit core concepts.
- Learn new technologies.
- Improve my English writing and technical documentation.
- Build consistency through daily habits like reading, note-taking, and coding.

---

## 📈 What's Next?

- Complete the Ultimate ASP.NET Core Web API book and build a complete production-grade API project.
- Choose the next book in the pipeline — possibly on Design Patterns, Software Architecture, or Distributed Systems.
- Improve folder organization and start adding markdown-based chapter summaries.
- Add a mini-site (using GitHub Pages) to showcase the books and progress visually.
